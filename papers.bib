	abstract = {Abstract Most firms covary more positively with downmarkets than upmarkets---a phenomenon I refer to as ``risk asymmetry.'' I predict and find that risk asymmetry is caused, at least in part, by a firm's ability to selectively obfuscate poor performance. Risk asymmetry decreases significantly when firms are required to adhere to the more stringent auditing standards mandated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, however this decrease is more muted for firms with weak internal controls. Consistent with my predictions, these patterns are stronger for more market-sensitive firms and weaker for firms that include relative performance evaluation in their CEOs' pay packages. Taken together with prior literature (which documents that risk asymmetry is priced), my results suggest that a firm can lower its cost of capital by credibly reducing its ability to obfuscate value-relevant information.},

@article{Li:2018tj,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT This study exploits the staggered adoption of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) by U.S. state courts as an exogenous shock that generates variations in the proprietary costs of disclosure. We find that firms respond to IDD adoption by reducing the level of disclosure regarding their customers' identities, supporting the proprietary cost hypothesis. Our results are stronger for firms in industries with a higher degree of entry threats, for firms in more volatile industries, and for firms with a lower degree of external financing dependence. Overall, this study represents one of the first efforts in identifying the causal effect of proprietary costs of disclosure on the supply of disclosure.},

@article{Fang:2016uy,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT During 2005 to 2007, the SEC ordered a pilot program in which one-third of the Russell 3000 index were arbitrarily chosen as pilot stocks and exempted from short-sale price tests. Pilot firms' discretionary accruals and likelihood of marginally beating earnings targets decrease during this period, and revert to pre-experiment levels when the program ends. After the program starts, pilot firms are more likely to be caught for fraud initiated before the program, and their stock returns better incorporate earnings information. These results indicate that short selling, or its prospect, curbs earnings management, helps detect fraud, and improves price efficiency.},

Using concurrent stock returns of non-U.S.-traded foreign firms to estimate normal U.S. returns, I find that U.S. firms experienced a statistically significant negative cumulative abnormal return around key SOX events. I then examine the cross-sectional variation of U.S. firms' returns around these events. Regression results are consistent with the non-audit services and governance provisions imposing net costs. Additional tests show that deferring the compliance of Section 404, which mandates an internal control test, resulted in significant cost savings for non-accelerated filers.},

@article{Dechow:1995wr,
	abstract = {This paper evaluates alternative accrual-based models for detecting earnings management. The evaluation compares the specification and power of commonly used test statistics across the measures of discretionary accruals generated by the models and provides the following major insights. First, all of the models appear well specified when applied to a random sample of firm-years. Second, the models all generate tests of low power for earnings management of economically plausible magnitudes (e.g., one to five percent of total assets). Third, all models reject the null hypothesis of no earnings management at rates exceeding the specified test-levels when applied to samples of firms with extreme financial performance. This result highlights the importance of controlling for financial performance when investigating earnings management stimuli that are correlated with financial performance. Finally, a modified version of the model developed by Jones (1991) exhibits the most power in detecting earnings management.},

@article{Ball:2019wu,
	abstract = {The Editor commissioned this replication of Ball and Brown (1968) for a special issue of the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal commemorating the 50th anniversary of its publication. We also describe the background to the original paper and its research design, and offer observations on its interpretation, its impact on the literature and practice, some negative consequences, and its relation to papers published around the same time. One of the pleasing attributes of our original paper is that its results consistently replicate, the implication being that the research design and its implementation uncovered a universal relation between accounting earnings and changes in firm values. The current replication is in two dimensions: time; and geography, with an emphasis on Pacific Basin countries. In the USA and in a selection of 16 other countries, annual accounting earnings continue to contain a large proportion of the information that investors trade into share prices over the year, though not in a timely fashion. Post earnings announcement drift, the first acknowledged share market anomaly, continues today despite being reported five decades ago. One change is that reporting lags internationally have shortened on average and their range has narrowed. A notable change in USA data is that the proportion of the information incorporated in share prices that is contemporaneously incorporated in annual accounting earnings has declined, though the conclusions we draw from this decline are more cautious than in Lev and Gu (2016).},

Based on inspection of the cross-sectional autocorrelation function, it is concluded that each series has (a) an adjacent quarter-to-quarter component and (b) a seasonal component. One-step-ahead forecasting results reveal that these two components can be successfully modelled at the individual firm level. The use of various quarterly forecasting models in security price analysis is also examined. The results are consistent with the market adjusting for seasonality in quarterly earnings in interpreting each quarter's earnings change.},

@article{Bamber:2000wv,
	abstract = {{We show that the community of accounting researchers has not fully appreciated the sensitivity of research conclusions to (necessarily) subjective research design choices, and that this failure has led to the subsequent overgeneralization of early evidence. Our analysis is based on a case study that examines the effects of two basic research design choices, and subsequent researchers' appreciation of the impact of those choices. To enhance our study's accessibility to a broad cross-section of the accounting research community, our case study focuses on an article that is covered in most accounting doctoral programs --- the recipient of the second American Accounting Association ``Seminal Contribution to Accounting Literature Award'' --- Beaver's 1968 article on the information content of annual earnings announcements [Beaver, W. (1968). The information content of annual earnings announcements. Empirical research in accounting; selected studies, 1968. Supplement to Journal of Accounting Research, 6, 67--92.] Our analysis reveals that the research design choices in Beaver's study significantly affected the results. Beaver clearly explained these choices, and was careful in drawing inferences. Nevertheless, subsequent researchers interpreted Beaver's evidence too broadly. Our new empirical evidence suggests that the information content inference is much more fragile than is generally suspected. We also present citation analyses showing that, consistent with the Kuhnian view that adherents of a paradigm tend to ignore (later) anomalous evidence, subsequent researchers largely overlooked post-Beaver evidence that was inconsistent with the paradigm's interpretation of Beaver's results. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of how cognitive biases of individuals, combined with biases inherent in the review process and the academy in general, foster an environment where the placement of the first research bricks affect the whole wall. While the case study focuses on an archival empirical financial accounting study, consideration of the effects of subjective research design choices and the documented deficiencies in the interpretation of research are relevant to empirical accounting researchers in general and to critical theorists, as well. While accounting scholars `think we understand' the impact of research design choices, the evidence presented here suggests that we have collectively failed to apply this understanding in practice. Such failure delays the acquisition of knowledge. This study provides a salient demonstration indicating that we must constantly remain on guard to recognize the subjective nature of research design choices, to consider the likely effects of those choices, and to be cautious in drawing generalizations.}},

To narrow this gap, we conducted a survey among the participants of the 2019 JAR Conference on their perceptions of the frequency, causes, and consequences of irreproducible research published in accounting journals. A majority of respondents believe that irreproducibility is common in the literature, constitutes a major problem, and receives too little attention. Most have encountered irreproducibility in the work of others (although not in their own work) but chose not to pursue their failed reproduction attempts to publication. Respondents believe irreproducibility results chiefly from career or publication incentives as well as from selective reporting of results. They also believe that practices like sharing code and data combined with stronger incentives to replicate the work of others would enhance reproducibility. The views of accounting researchers are remarkably similar to those expressed in a survey by the scientific journal Nature. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and provide several potential paths forward for the accounting research community.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Given the competition for top journal space, there is an incentive to produce ``significant'' results. With the combination of unreported tests, lack of adjustment for multiple tests, and direct and indirect p-hacking, many of the results being published will fail to hold up in the future. In addition, there are basic issues with the interpretation of statistical significance. Increasing thresholds may be necessary, but still may not be sufficient: if the effect being studied is rare, even t > 3 will produce a large number of false positives. Here I explore the meaning and limitations of a p-value. I offer a simple alternative (the minimum Bayes factor). I present guidelines for a robust, transparent research culture in financial economics. Finally, I offer some thoughts on the importance of risk-taking (from the perspective of authors and editors) to advance our field. SUMMARY Empirical research in financial economics relies too much on p-values, which are poorly understood in the first place. Journals want to publish papers with positive results and this incentivizes researchers to engage in data mining and ``p-hacking.'' The outcome will likely be an embarrassing number of false positives---effects that will not be repeated in the future. The minimum Bayes factor (which is a function of the p-value) combined with prior odds provides a simple solution that can be reported alongside the usual p-value. The Bayesianized p-value answers the question: What is the probability that the null is true? The same technique can be used to answer: What threshold of t-statistic do I need so that there is only a 5\% chance that the null is true? The threshold depends on the economic plausibility of the hypothesis.},

@article{Simmons:2011ux,
	abstract = { In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. },

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The papers in this volume were published through a Registration-based Editorial Process (REP). Authors submitted proposals to gather and analyze data; successful proposals were guaranteed publication as long as the authors lived up to their commitments, regardless of whether results supported their predictions. To understand how REP differs from the Traditional Editorial Process (TEP), we analyze the papers themselves; conference comments; a survey of conference authors, reviewers, and attendees; and a survey of authors who have successfully published under TEP. We find that REP increases up-front investment in planning, data gathering, and analysis, but reduces follow-up investment after results are known. This shift in investment makes individual results more reproducible, but leaves articles less thorough and refined. REP could be improved by encouraging selected forms of follow-up investment that survey respondents believe are usually used under TEP to make papers more informative, focused, and accurate at little risk of overstatement.},

@article{Bao:2020aa,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT We develop a state-of-the-art fraud prediction model using a machine learning approach. We demonstrate the value of combining domain knowledge and machine learning methods in model building. We select our model input based on existing accounting theories, but we differ from prior accounting research by using raw accounting numbers rather than financial ratios. We employ one of the most powerful machine learning methods, ensemble learning, rather than the commonly used method of logistic regression. To assess the performance of fraud prediction models, we introduce a new performance evaluation metric commonly used in ranking problems that is more appropriate for the fraud prediction task. Starting with an identical set of theory-motivated raw accounting numbers, we show that our new fraud prediction model outperforms two benchmark models by a large margin: the Dechow et al. logistic regression model based on financial ratios, and the Cecchini et al. support-vector-machine model with a financial kernel that maps raw accounting numbers into a broader set of ratios.},

@article{Dyck:2010wi,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT To identify the most effective mechanisms for detecting corporate fraud, we study all reported fraud cases in large U.S. companies between 1996 and 2004. We find that fraud detection does not rely on standard corporate governance actors (investors, SEC, and auditors), but rather takes a village, including several nontraditional players (employees, media, and industry regulators). Differences in access to information, as well as monetary and reputational incentives, help to explain this pattern. In-depth analyses suggest that reputational incentives in general are weak, except for journalists in large cases. By contrast, monetary incentives help explain employee whistleblowing.},
