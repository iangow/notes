        "\n",
        "The first two pages of @Ball:1968ub address the (then) extant accounting literature.\n",
        "This discussion gives the impression that the (academic) conventional wisdom at that time was that accounting numbers were (more or less) meaningless (\"the difference between twenty-seven tables and eight chairs\") and further research was needed to devise more meaningful accounting systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguably this notion informs the null hypothesis of @Ball:1968ub.\n",
        "If accounting numbers are meaningless, then they should bear no relationship to economic decisions made by rational actors.\n",
        "@Ball:1968ub seek to test this (null) hypothesis by examining the relationship between security returns and unexpected income changes.\n",
        "@Ball:1968ub argue that \"recent developments in capital theory ... [justify] selecting the behavior of security prices as an operational test of usefulness.\" \n",
        "\n",
        "The evidence provided by @Ball:1968ub might not convince critics of the usefulness of adding chairs and tables unless the market is a rational, efficient user of a broader set of information.\n",
        "There are accounts for the results of @Ball:1968ub that do not rely on such rationality and efficiency.\n",
        "First, the market might react to \"twenty-seven tables less eight chairs\" because it does not know what it is doing.\n",
        "Second, the market might know that \"twenty-seven tables less eight chairs\" is meaningless, but has no better information to rely upon.\n",
        "Given the arguments they seek to address, assumptions that the market is (a) efficient and (b) has access to a rich information set beyond earnings seem implicit in the use of security returns in a test of usefulness.\n",
        "\n",
        "@Ball:2019wu [p. 414] identify three main results of @Ball:1968ub:\n",
        "\"The most fundamental result was that accounting earnings and stock returns were correlated. ...\n",
        "Nevertheless, annual accounting earnings lacked timeliness. ...\n",
        "After the earnings announcement month, the API (which cumulated abnormal returns) continued to drift in the same direction.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 1 of @Ball:1968ub depicts the data provided in Table 5 and comprises all three of the principal results flagged by @Ball:2019wu.\n",
        "\n",
        "The returns reported in Figure 1 of @Ball:1968ub are not feasible portfolios because the earnings variables used to form each portfolio at month $-12$ are not reliably available until month $0$ or later.\n",
        "Yet one can posit the existence of a mechanism (e.g., a time machine or a magical genie) that would suffice to make the portfolios notionally feasible.\n",
        "For example, if a genie could tell us whether earnings for the upcoming year for each firm will increase or decrease at month $-12$, we could go long on firms expecting positive news, and go short on firms expecting negative news.^[Actually, because the lines of Figure 1 represent *abnormal* returns, the associated portfolios involve going long or short in each of a group of stocks and short or long in a broader market index at the same time.]\n",
        "Note that this hypothetical genie is sparing with the information she provides.\n",
        "For example, we might want further details on how much earnings increased or decreased, but our genie gives us just the sign of the earnings news.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we have implicit constraints on the way we can use this information in forming portfolios.\n",
        "We might do better to adjust the portfolio weights according to other factors, such as size or liquidity, but the portfolios implicit in Figure 1 of @Ball:1968ub do not do this.\n",
        "Nor do the portfolios represented in Figure 1  involve any opportunity to adjust portfolio weights during the year.\n",
        "\n",
        "In assessing the relative value of various sources of information, @Ball:1968ub consider three approaches to constructing portfolios, which they denote as *TI*, *NI*, and *II* (@Ball:2019wu denote *II* as *AI* and we follow this notation below).\n",
        "Using these metrics, @Ball:1968ub [p. 176] conclude that \"of all the information about an individual firm which becomes available during a year, one-half or more is captured in that year's income number. ...\n",
        "However, the annual income report does not rate highly as a timely medium, since most of its content (about 85 to 90 per cent) is captured by more prompt media which perhaps include interim reports.\"^[For more on the \"apparent paradox\" discussed on p.176, see @Leftwich:1994ws.]\n",
        "\n",
        "The third principal result is shown in Table 5, where we see that the income surprise is correlated with the API to a statistically significant extent in each month up to two months after the earnings announcement.^[There are some months where this does not hold, but the statement is broadly true.]\n",
        "\n",
        "This result, which later become known as **post-earnings announcement drift** (or simply **PEAD**), was troubling to @Ball:1968ub, who argue that some of it may be explained by  \"peak-ahead\" in the measure of market income and transaction costs causing delays in trade. \\index{Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD)}\n",
