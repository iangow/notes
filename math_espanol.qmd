Due to the tragic passing of a colleague, my wife has taken over the support of students participating in competitions such as MathCounts at the school at which she is a mathematics specialist.
Often she seeks my input on solving problems and asked me about the problem that requires replacing letters with digits to solve the following equation:

```
  DOS +
  DOS
 TRES
-----
SIETE
```

My natural inclination was to use a mix of brute force and educated guesses.
For example, it seems that one could narrow down `S` to be 1 because even the greatest sum of two three-digit numbers and one four-digit number is $999 + 999 + 9999 = 11997$.
This then suggests `E` is `3` ...

At this point, I wanted a way to check a solution quickly.
In my mind, a solution is a mapping of each of the letters in the equation above to the digits $\{0, 1, \dots, 8, 9\}$.
And then a mapping is just another word for a **dictionary** in Python.

I start by putting the words into a **list**:

```{python}
words = ["dos", "dos", "tres", "siete"]
```

I then need to work out what letters need to be mapped to digits.
It is helpful to note that iterating over a string containing a word yields the letters in that string.

```{python}
[letter for letter in "dos"]
```

I can use a list comprehension to do that for all words in `words`.

```{python}
[letter for word in words for letter in word]
```

Of course, I get some duplicates and I can use `set()` to clean this up.

```{python}
set([letter for word in words for letter in word])
```

Finally, I stick this logic in a function `get_letters()`.

```{python}
def get_letters(words):
    return set([letter for word in words for letter in word])
```

Through brute force, I might come up with a solution such as `sol_candidate`:

```{python}
sol_candidate = {'o': 8, 't': 9, 's': 1, 'r': 2, 'e': 4, 'i': 0, 'd': 6}
```

To check this candidate solution, I need to convert each word into a number and then check the equation.
Given a word, I can start by iterating over the string and getting the digit assigned to each letter.

```{python}
[sol_candidate[letter] for letter in "dos"]
```

I next convert each digit into a string.^[In some ways, it might have made sense to construct `sol_candidate` so that the values were strings to start with, but we will see there's no problem with the current set-up.]

```{python}
[str(sol_candidate[letter]) for letter in "dos"]
```

I can combine the digits into a single string using `''.join()`:

```{python}
''.join([str(sol_candidate[letter]) for letter in "dos"])
```

And finally, I turn this string into an integer using `int()`:

```{python}
int(''.join([str(sol_candidate[letter]) for letter in "dos"]))
```

Now I can stick this logic into a function taking a `string` and a dictionary (`mapping`) and returning an integer:

```{python}
def to_val(string, mapping):
    return int(''.join([str(mapping[i]) for i in string]))
```

```{python}
def check_map(words, code):
    first_sum = sum([to_val(word, code) for word in words[:-1]])
    second_sum = to_val(words[-1], code)
    return first_sum == second_sum
```

```{python}
import itertools

def get_maps(letters):
    digits = range(10)
    vals = [i for i in itertools.permutations(digits, len(letters))]
    all_maps = [dict(zip(letters, i)) for i in vals]
    return all_maps
```

```{python}
def solve_problem(words):
    letters = get_letters(words)
    codes = get_maps(letters)
    results = [code for code in codes if check_map(words, code)]
    return [res for res in results if res]
```



```{python}
solution = solve_problem(words)
solution
```

```{python}
check_map(words, solution[0])
```
