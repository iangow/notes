Denote $AD$ as $x$ and $BD$ as $y$.
We know that ${AC}^2 = 12^2 + x^2$ and that ${BC}^2 = 12^2 + y^2$.
But we also know that  ${AC}^2 + {BC}^2 = {AB}^2$ and that $AB = x + y$.
This means we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
12^2 + x^2 + 12^2 + y^2 &=  (x + y)^2 \\
288 + x^2 + y^2 &=  x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\
xy &= 144
\end{aligned}
$$


But we need $12^2 + x^2$ to be a perfect square, which rules out $x < 5$ (the smallest perfect square above $12^2 = 144$ is $13^2 = 169$, which requires that $x = 5$, as $169 - 144 = 25$).
Similarly we can rule out $y < 5$.

So we have:

$$(x, y) \in \{ (6, 24), (8, 18), (9, 16), (12,12), (16, 9), (18, 8), (24, 6) \}.$$

If $x = 6$, $12^2 + x^2 = 144 + 36 = 180$, which is not a perfect square.
We can rule out $y = 6$ for the same reason.

If $x = 8$, ${AC}^2 = 12^2 + x^2 = 144 + 64 = 208$, which is not a perfect square.
For the same reason, we can rule ouf $y = 8$.

If $x = 9$, ${AC}^2 = 12^2 + x^2 = 144 + 81 = 225$, which is a perfect square and we have $AC = 15$.
If $x = 9$, then $y = 16$, which gives $BC = \sqrt{12^2 + 16 ^ 2} = 20$.
We then have $AB = \sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$.
So the perimeter is $AC + BC + AB = 15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.

If $x = 12$, ${AC}^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 = 144 + 144 = 288$, which is not a perfect square.

If $x = 16$, ${AC}^2 = 12^2 + x^2 = 144 + 256 = 400$, which is a perfect square and we have $AC = 20$.
If $x = 16$, then $y = 9$, which gives $BC = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = 25$.
We then have $AB^2 = 20^2 + 25^2 = 1025$, which is not a perfect square.

The minimum perimeter has $AC + BC + AB = 15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.
