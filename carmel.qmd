## What is accounting research?

 - Accounting researchers live in business schools or CPA schools
    - Peak at top business schools (Chicago, MIT, Wharton, Stanford)
 - At that level, accounting is overwhelmingly focused on 
   - causal inference
   - using observational (mostly *archival*) data
   - on questions with an "economic" tinge
 - A lot like empiricial corporate finance, but with more focus on "information in markets"

### Recommendations

- Reject "silly questions" papers
- Emphasize replication
- De-emphasize "identification strategies"
- Research training about p-hacking
- More descriptive research

:::

## Questions

- Does an emphasis on fraud help or hurt quest to address p-hacking?
  - p-hacking presents a greater threat to scientific value because of prevalence
- How to address recalcitrant fields?
  - Top journals in accounting fairly hostile to improving code-and-data sharing ("malevolent replicator")
- How to transition?
  - Current human capital highly invested in current model
  - Without p-hacking, what will researchers do?
