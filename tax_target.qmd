A recurring problem in accounting research is poorly thought-out research designs where a null hypothesis is assumed to imply zero coefficients in some regression without any effort to check that this is the case.
@Beardsley_2021 illustrates this problem nicely.
@Beardsley_2021 [p. 1] state that "using year-end effective tax rate (ETR) manipulation as our setting, we find that firms decrease ETRs from 3rd to 4th quarter to meet or beat a greater percentage of individual forecast. ... Our study highlights the strategic nature of earnings management by providing evidence that managers consider individual forecasts to calibrate earnings management decisions."

The main result from @Beardsley_2021 [p. 11] is provided by Table 5, which presents two regressions, one for each of two sub-samples.
The key results are a positive coefficient on *PREBEAT_AMT* for *PREBEAT* firms and a negative coefficient on *PREMISS_AMT* for *PREMISS* firms.

But I can simulate precisely these results with no earnings management.
I assume nothing more than random variation in ETRs from Q3 to Q4 and that analysts know the Q4 effective tax rate.

In writing this note, I use the packages listed below.^[Execute `install.packages(c("tidyverse", modelsummary"))` within R to install all the packages you need to run the code in this note.]
This note was written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and compiled with [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with R.
The source code for this note is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iangow/notes/main/tax_target.qmd) and the latest version of this PDF is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iangow/notes/main/tax_target.pdf).

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(modelsummary)
```

In the code below, I generate data for 1,000 firms and draw ETRs for Q3 and Q4 from independent uniform distributions of the range 33%--37%.

```{r}
n <- 1000
etr_3 <- runif(n = n, min = 0.33, max = 0.37)
etr_4 <- runif(n = n, min = 0.33, max = 0.37)
```

I then draw forecasts of pretax earnings from a normal distribution.
Forecasts of after-tax earnings are simply pre-tax earnings times a factor equal to one minus Q4 ETR.

```{r}
ebt_forecast <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 1, sd = 0.2)
ni_forecast <- ebt_forecast * (1 - etr_4)
```

Realized pre-tax earnings are simply the forecast plus noise and realized after-tax earnings are realized pre-tax earnings times a factor equal to one minus Q4 ETR.

```{r}
ebt_actual <- ebt_forecast + rnorm(n = n, sd = 0.1)
ni_actual <- ni_forecast * (1 - etr_4)
```

I combine the relevant data from above into a data frame and calculate variables for the regression following the descriptions in Appendix A of @Beardsley_2021 [p. 14--15]. 

```{r}
df <- 
  tibble(etr_3, etr_4, ebt_actual, ni_forecast, ni_actual) |>
  mutate(amount = ni_forecast - ebt_actual * (1 - etr_3),
         premiss_amt = amount,
         premiss = premiss_amt > 0,
         prebeat = premiss_amt < 0,
         prebeat_amt = -amount)
```

I then run the regressions shown in Table 5 of @Beardsley_2021 [p. 11].
Results are shown in @tbl-5.
There you can see I have reproduced the key results of @Beardsley_2021.
However, the null result of "no earnings management" is true here.
As such, it is not clear that @Beardsley_2021 show anything.

I have written [elsewhere](https://github.com/iangow/notes/blob/main/elephants.pdf) that the scourge of near-ubiquitous p-hacking makes accounting research of very dubious merit.
If null hypotheses can be rejected simply because it is assumed that they imply zero coefficients, then this only adds to these concerns.^[One doesn't even need to p-hack if one runs regressions where the null hypothesis implies non-zero coefficients and one assumes that they do not.]

 @Beardsley_2021 was published in the *Journal of Accounting and Economics*, one of the top journals in accounting.
 The acknowledgement note thanks an editor, a referee, at least three discussants, and many luminous members of the accounting firmament.
 This suggests that plausibly mechanical nature of the results in @Beardsley_2021 never occurred to any of these people.^[One has to be careful here, as one should not interpret any kind of endorsement of a paper from mentions in the acknowledgements.]
 From conceiving this simulation to writing this note took about half an hour; so the bar is not high!

```{r}
fms <- list(
  lm(etr_4 - etr_3 ~ prebeat_amt, data = df, subset = prebeat),
  lm(etr_4 - etr_3 ~ premiss_amt, data = df, subset = premiss)
)
```


```{r}
#| label: tbl-5
#| tbl-cap: Replication of Table 5 of @Beardsley_2021
#| echo: false
modelsummary(fms,
             estimate = "{estimate}{stars}",
             statistic = "{statistic}",
             gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"),
             stars = c('*' = .1, '**' = 0.05, '***' = .01))
```
