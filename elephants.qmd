# Five elephants?

Ohlson \[2022\] discusses what he calls "elephants in the room" (or taboo topics) and discusses "five elephants". But perhaps there are not five elephants so much five alternative descriptions of the one elephant, much like the parable of the [blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).

What exactly is that elephant in the room? I posit that the predominant mode of research in academic accounting in 2022 is $p$-hacking and argue that the five elements can be viewed as alternative perspectives on the same elephant, i.e., $p$-hacking.

# A replication crisis? {#rep-crisis}

A [Financial Times article by Robert Wigglesworth](https://www.ft.com/content/9025393f-76da-4b8f-9436-4341485c75d0) covered the alleged "replication crisis" in finance research. Wigglesworth quotes Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University, who suggests that "at least half of the 400 supposedly market-beating strategies identified in top financial journals over the years are bogus."

Wigglesworth identified "the heart of the issue" as what researchers call **p-hacking**, which is the practice whereby researchers search for "significant" and "positive" results. Here "significant" refers to statistical significance and "positive" refers to results that reject so-called "null hypotheses" and thereby (allegedly) pushing human knowledge forward. @Harvey:2017ux cites research suggesting that 90% of published studies report such "significant" and "positive" results. Reporting "positive" results is important not only for getting published, but also for attracting citations, which drive behaviour for both researchers and journals.

@Simmons:2011ux \[p. 1359\] describe what they term **researcher degrees of freedom**. "In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?" @Simmons:2011ux [p. 1364] identify another well-known researcher degree of freedom, namely that of "reporting only experiments that 'work'", which is known as the **file-drawer problem** (because experiments that don't "work" are put in a file-drawer).

To illustrate the power of researcher degrees of freedom, @Simmons:2011ux conducted two experiments with live subjects and describe the results of two hypothetical studies based on those experiments. They argue that these studies "demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis" [p. 1359]. @Simmons:2011ux [p. 1359] conclude that "flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates."

Perhaps in response to concerns similar to those raised by @Simmons:2011ux, the *Journal of Accounting Research* (JAR) conducted a trial for its [annual conference held in May 2017](https://research.chicagobooth.edu/arc/journal-of-accounting-research/jar-annual-conference/conference-web-casts/2017). According to the JAR website, at this conference "authors presented papers developed through a Registration-based Editorial Process (REP). The goal of the conference was to see whether REP could be implemented for accounting research, and to explore how such a process could be best implemented. Papers presented at the conference were subsequently published in May 2018. As summarized by @Bloomfield:2018va, we learned a lot through the process of developing and publishing these papers, and deemed the experiment a success, but also an ongoing learning process."

According to @Bloomfield:2018va [p. 317], "under REP, authors propose a plan to gather and analyze data to test their predictions. Journals send promising proposals to one or more reviewers and recommend revisions. Authors are given the opportunity to review their proposal in response, often multiple times, before the proposal is either rejected or granted in-principle acceptance ... regardless of whether [subsequent] results support their predictions."

@Bloomfield:2018va [p. 317] contrast REP with the Traditional Editorial Process ("TEP"). Under the TEP, "authors gather their data, analyze it, and write and revise their manuscripts repeatedly before sending them to editors." @Bloomfield:2018va [p. 317] suggest that "almost all peer-reviewed articles in social science are published under ... the TEP."

The REP is designed to eliminate some of questionable research practices, including those identified by @Simmons:2011ux. For example, one form of p-hacking is **HARKing** (from "Hypothesizing After Results are Known"). In its extreme form, HARKing involves searching for a "significant" correlation and *then* developing a hypothesis to "predict" it. To illustrate, consider the [spurious correlations website](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) provided by Tyler Vigen. This site lists a number of evidently spurious correlations, such as the 99.26% correlation between the divorce rate in Maine and margarine consumption or the 99.79% correlation between US spending on science, space, and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation. The correlations are deemed spurious because normal human beings have strong prior beliefs that there is no underlying causal relation explaining these correlations. Instead, these are regarded as mere coincidence.

However, a creative academic can probably craft a story to "predict" any correlation. Perhaps increasing spending on science raises its perceived importance to society. But drawing attention to science only serves to highlight how the US has inevitably declined in relative stature in many fields, including science. While many Americans can carry on notwithstanding this decline, others are less sanguine about it and may go to extreme lengths as a result ... . This is clearly a silly line of reasoning, but if one added some references to published studies and fancy terminology, it would probably read a lot like the hypothesis development sections of some academic papers.

I consider each of the five elephants, starting with the one that Ohlson [2022] lists last: "Issues related to 'screen-picking' and 'data-snooping'".
Terms like "data-snooping" are simply synonyms of $p$-hacking, which is well understood by many to be a major issue in the social sciences.
I suggest that the insight of Ohlson [2022] is that merely suggesting the possibility of $p$-hacking is taboo ("unacceptable", "a personal assault", "too sordid", "testing ethical boundaries", and "a more or less painful private matter").

## Anecdotes

I conjecture that blind p-hacking is actually more common than motivated p-hacking and offer the following (paraphrased) anecdotes as examples:

### Anecdote #1 {-}

Me: "Why did you look at $y_1$? 
Wouldn't $y_2$ or $y_3$ be the natural things to examine?"

Doctoral student(s) at a good school: "I already looked at those. They didn't work, so I dropped them."

### Anecdote #2 {-}

Me: "Your paper is about $y_1$? Wouldn't $y_2$ or $y_3$ be the natural things to examine as consequences of $X$?"

Senior faculty at a good school: "We already looked at those.
They didnâ€™t work, so we wrote a paper about $y_1$ instead."

### Anecdote #3 {-}

Colleague: "I have found that $x$ and $y$ are associated and I think the reason is [some causal story]."

Me: "But [some causal story] just isn't plausible."

Colleague: "Oh. So you think I need to come up with some other story then?"

### Anecdote #4:

Colleague of colleague at one school to colleague at a good school: "I have data on $X$, perhaps I can send you these data and you can regress various $y$ variables that you have on $X$. If something works, perhaps we could collaborate."

# What to do?

It is important to understand that if, say, 90% of research is p-hacked, that one cannot simply read the 10% that is not p-hacked and ignore the rest.
If it were easy to detect the p-hacked papers, we could simply avoid publishing them.
But I argue there are steps that could be taken to reduce p-hacking to an extent that research in aggregate has some value?

## Reject papers that ask silly questions

Accounting academics appear to adore "novelty", where novelty often means asking questions that no-one has even dreamed of asking before.
This is problematic for two reasons.
First, if questions are so novel that no-one has asked them, how can they be important?
Second, the ability to simply make up "interesting" research questions is a p-hacker's dream.

Too often the bar seems to be "has someone [in prior research] asked this question before?" and if the answer is "no" then the novelty bar has been cleared.
But after more than 50 years of modern empirical accounting research, the fact that no-one has asked a question should in most cases be a strike *against* a paper, not for it.
If no-one has addressed the question, then it is perhaps because no-one cares what the answer is.
If editors adopted a policy of desk-rejecting papers that ask silly questions, the pay-off to p-hacking would decline significantly.
