# Five elephants or one?

@Ohlson:2022aa identifies five of what he calls "elephants in the room" (or topics considered taboo in seminars).
I read these not so much as five elephants, but as five alternative descriptions of the one elephant, much like the elephant in the parable of the [blind men and an elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).

What exactly is that elephant in the room?
I argue that Ohlson's five elephants are simply alternative perspectives on the same elephant, i.e., p-hacking, which is the practice whereby researchers search for "significant" and "positive" results.^[Here "significant" refers to statistical significance and "positive" refers to results that reject so-called "null hypotheses" and thereby (purportedly) push human knowledge forward.]
To be sure, this is a very big elephant: I conjecture that p-hacking is the dominant mode of research in academic accounting in 2022.

That the basic concern of @Ohlson:2022aa is with p-hacking is clearest with the last of his five elephants: "Issues related to 'screen-picking' and 'data-snooping'".
Terms like "data-snooping" are simply synonyms of p-hacking.
The key insight of @Ohlson:2022aa may be in highlighting how merely suggesting the possibility of p-hacking is taboo (@Ohlson:2022aa uses terms such as "unacceptable", "a personal assault", "too sordid", "testing ethical boundaries", and "a more or less painful private matter").

Many researchers appear not to understand how p-hacking vitiates the whole research endeavour.
So if even suggesting the possibility p-hacking is taboo, it will be much more difficult to address and accounting research will continue to be a largely pointless exercise as a result.

# The anatomy of p-hacking

In a recent [Financial Times article by Robert Wigglesworth](https://www.ft.com/content/9025393f-76da-4b8f-9436-4341485c75d0) Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University, suggests that "at least half of the 400 supposedly market-beating strategies identified in top financial journals over the years are bogus."
@Harvey:2017ux cites research suggesting that 90% of published studies report the "significant" and "positive" results.
Reporting "positive" results is important not only for getting published, but also for attracting citations, which drive behaviour for both researchers and journals.

@Simmons:2011ux [p. 1359] provide analyses that "demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis ... [due to] flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates."

@Simmons:2011ux [p. 1359] attribute this flexibility to **researcher degrees of freedom**.
"In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected?
Should some observations be excluded?
Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared?
Which control variables should be considered?
Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both?" @Simmons:2011ux [p.
1364] identify another well-known researcher degree of freedom, namely that of "reporting only experiments that 'work'", which is known as the **file-drawer problem** (because experiments that don't "work" are put in a file-drawer).

Another form of p-hacking is **HARKing** (from "Hypothesizing After Results are Known").
In its extreme form, HARKing involves searching for a "significant" correlation and *then* developing a hypothesis to "predict" it.
To illustrate, consider the [spurious correlations website](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) provided by Tyler Vigen.
This site lists a number of evidently spurious correlations, such as the 99.26% correlation between the divorce rate in Maine and margarine consumption or the 99.79% correlation between US spending on science, space, and technology and suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation.
The correlations are deemed spurious because normal human beings have strong prior beliefs that there is no underlying causal relation explaining these correlations.
Instead, these are regarded as mere coincidence.

However, a creative academic can probably craft a story to "predict" any correlation: Perhaps increasing spending on science raises its perceived importance to society.
But drawing attention to science only serves to highlight how the US has inevitably declined in relative stature in many fields, including science.
While many Americans can carry on notwithstanding this decline, others are less sanguine about it and may go to extreme lengths as a result ... .
This is a clearly silly line of reasoning, but if one added some references to published studies and fancy terminology, it would probably read a lot like the hypothesis development sections of academic papers presented in the empirical accounting seminars discussed by @Ohlson:2022aa.

@Bloomfield:2018va [p. 317] suggest that "almost all peer-reviewed articles in social science are published under" what they call ... the Traditional Editorial Process (or TEP).
Under the TEP, "authors gather their data, analyze it, and write and revise their manuscripts repeatedly before sending them to editors." As such authors have access to many researcher degrees of freedom.

An alternative to the TEP is what @Bloomfield:2018va call the Registration-based Editorial Process (REP).
According to @Bloomfield:2018va [p. 317], "under REP, authors propose a plan to gather and analyze data to test their predictions.
Journals send promising proposals to one or more reviewers and recommend revisions.
Authors are given the opportunity to review their proposal in response, often multiple times, before the proposal is either rejected or granted in-principle acceptance ... regardless of whether [subsequent] results support their predictions." 
The REP is designed to eliminate research degrees of freedom and the questionable research practices that these permit.

The *Journal of Accounting Research* (JAR) conducted a trial of the REP for its [annual conference held in May 2017](https://research.chicagobooth.edu/arc/journal-of-accounting-research/jar-annual-conference/conference-web-casts/2017).
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the REP will replace the TEP to any great extent in the foreseeable future.
The REP is feasible when data are generated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as the data simply do not exist when the report is registered.
In contrast, most empirical accounting research uses existing archival data making it impossible to register a report before being able to look at the data.

# Evidence of p-hacking

## Conversational evidence

@Ohlson:2022aa's notion that raising issues related to p-hacking is taboo in empirical accounting seminars seems very plausible.
Outside of papers like @Simmons:2011ux that aim to demonstrate the "power" of p-hacking, we generally only see circumstantial evidence of p-hacking in the papers themselves.^[I discuss such evidence below.]
But sometimes (outside of seminars!) researchers can be fairly candid about their research process, as the following anecdotes reveal.
These anecdotes draw from actual conversations with colleagues, but I present them in a stylized fashion.^[Also see my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/p-hacking-accounting-research-ian-gow) on this topic.]

### Anecdote #1 {-}

- Me: "Why did you look at $y_1$?
Wouldn't $y_2$ or $y_3$ be the natural things to examine?" 
- Doctoral student(s) at a good school: "I already looked at those.
They didn't work, so I dropped them."

### Anecdote #2 {-}

- Me: "Your paper is about $y_1$.
Wouldn't $y_2$ or $y_3$ be the natural things to examine as consequences of $X$?" 
- Senior faculty at a good school: "We already looked at those.
They didn't work, so we wrote a paper about $y_1$ instead."

### Anecdote #3 {-}

- Colleague: "I have found that $x$ and $y$ are associated and I think the reason is [some causal story]."
- Me: "But [some causal story] just isn't plausible." 
- Colleague: "Oh. So you think I need to come up with some other story then?"

### Anecdote #4 {-}

- Colleague of colleague to colleague: "I have data on $X$, perhaps I can send you these data and you can regress various $y$ variables that you have on $X$.
If something works, perhaps we could collaborate."

Outside the setting of seminars, gentle prodding can lead authors to reveal p-hacking.
The first two anecdotes are similar and reveal a kind of "old school" p-hacking of the kind underlying the file-drawer problem.
The last two reflect a seemingingly mindless search that only requires "predictions" when "results" have been found.

## Evidence from the 2017 JAR REP trial

@Bloomfield:2018va [p. 326] examine the results reported in the 2017 JAR conference papers and conclude that "of the 30 predictions made in the ... seven proposals, we count 10 as being supported at $p \leq 0.05$ by at least one of the 134 statistical tests the authors reported." 
But this is very close to the level of support expected if the null hypotheses for all 30 predictions were true.
This is particularly concerning in that it seems reasonable to expect that the alternative hypotheses considered in the 2017 JAR conference papers were deemed by the authors and reviewers to be worth pursuing before knowing their results, which is a higher bar than applied to hypotheses tested using the TEP.
In other words, the results of the 2017 JAR conference raised the prospect that many results produced by the TEP (i.e., almost all research in accounting) are simply false rejections of true null hypotheses.

## Circumstantial evidence from replications

Another source of evidence on the prevalence of p-hacking is replications.
We expect that p-hacked papers will have results that are very fragile.
By definition, p-hacked results are not expected to be **reproducible**.
That is, we would not expect the results to hold if the same analytical procedures were applied to a new data set.^[Here I follow @Hail:2020aa in distinguishing replicability from reproducibility.]

But p-hacked results should pass the test of **replicability**, which requires that the results can be produced by other authors using the same data sets and analytical procedures.
But in practice, it seems that few results can be replicated, as small departures from the choices made by the authors along the dimensions described in @Simmons:2011ux can lead to apparent results disappearing (i.e., becoming statistically insignificant) and few papers describe these choices sufficiently clearly to allow precise replication. 

While one solution to this issue is for authors to supply the data and code needed to replicate their results, for a number of reasons, very few authors do so.

Authors have essentially no incentive to provide data and code voluntarily.
Once a paper has been published, for an author focused on publishing papers, there is really only downside from sharing code and data.
The results in the published paper might result from coding errors.
And if the results have been p-hacked, sharing code and data dramatically lowers the cost of showing how fragile the results are.
On top of this lack of positive incentives is the reality that most researchers appear to be poor in organizing their code and that significant costs would need to incurred to prepare code and data for sharing.^[This likely to be especially true when results are derived from the often messy process of p-hacking.]

In the absence of incentives for voluntary disclosure of code, some kind of requirement for sharing seems necessary.
However, only one of the top three accounting journals (*Journal of Accounting Research*) imposes [requirements](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/1475679x/homepage/ForAuthors.html) for data and code, but even then rarely do these requirements yield files that permit easy replication of tables found in papers.^[The *Journal of Accounting and Economics* merely "[encourages](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-accounting-and-economics/0165-4101/guide-for-authors)" authors to share replication files. 
And there is nothing on this issue in the [editorial policy](https://meridian.allenpress.com/DocumentLibrary/AAAN/TAR_Editorial_Policy.pdf) of *The Accounting Review*, which does not appear to provide any support for such sharing.]

Given that much of the published research in accounting uses data sets that are available to most researchers and papers typically include descriptions of the analytical procedures used, other researchers should be able to replicate results independently even without access to code and data.
In practice, few papers are replicated in this way.

First, replication is a costly exercise.
Most empirical researchers already spend a large portion of their research time in the critical pre-tenure phase of their careers writing code to analyse data.
Independently replicating others' papers is likely to be considered a poor use of very limited time.

Second, even if one invests in replication, anecdotal evidence suggests that reproducing results in published papers can be very difficult.
Ask another researcher whether she has tried to replicate results of a published paper and you are likely to hear that attempts have been made, but without success.^[Some researchers' replication experiences are limited to exercises assigned during PhD coursework, but there is a natural selection bias with these, as many instructors would look to assign exercises where results can be reproduced.]

I have extensive experience with attempted replication of papers.
My ill-fated PhD dissertation attempted to identify a causal mechanism underlying the numerous results in the literature suggesting a contracting value for firms voluntary adoption of higher levels of conditional conservatism.
My paper sought to identify the mechanism that firms used to make these choices.
However, explaining results documented in research proved difficult when those results simply cannot be replicated, as almost all replications I tried failed.

Since then I have undertaken many attempted replications and most fail.
One theory might be that I simply do not know how to analyse data properly and that a more skilled researcher would be able to reproduce published results.
While it is difficult to refute this theory, I believe a significant recent project offers evidence against it.

In 2021, a University of Melbourne colleague (Tony Ding) and I started to pull together a course book [@Gow:2022aa] aimed at helping research students to develop the portfolio of skills needed to be good researchers in accounting.
As discussed [in the book](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/introduction.html#features-of-this-course), a core element is material focused on data analysis skills, included many replication analyses.
It seems these replication efforts can be organized into two eras.

The first era covers 1968 through to about 1996.
The striking thing about this era is how robust the results appear to be.
Like many before us, [we find](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/bb1968.html) that the key results of the seminal @Ball:1968ub are easily replicated, and @Ball:2019wu show this is true in different markets and periods.
[We find](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/beaver68.html) that key results of @Beaver:1968vf hold in any year we look at.^[@Bamber:2000wv raise concerns about the reproducibility of the results, concerns that do not appear to hold in years after @Beaver:1968vf was published.]
Not only can [we generate the core results](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/pead.html) of @Bernard:1989uu, but [we broadly replicate](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/pead.html#time-series-properties-of-earnings) @Foster:1977wy along the way.
Replications of @Sloan:1996wd and @Dechow:1995wr are also successful.

The second era covers papers from the current century and reveals a different story.
Our book provides replications of numerous papers from this era, including @Zhang:2007tv, @Fang:2016uy, @Li:2018tj, and @Bloomfield:2021va.

The first observation is that each of the papers can be replicated in some sense.
But it is important to note that our replications often benefit from access to code and data provided by the authors.
@Fang:2016uy posted code and data starting from original sources and continuing through the production of (some) key results in their paper.
@Bloomfield:2021va provided code under the journal's data policy.^[We did not have access to code for @Zhang:2007tv, but that paper is unusually straightforward and based on a standard data set (CRSP).]

Often p-hacked results will hold in what a mathematician might term an **$\epsilon$-neighbourhood** of the results reported in the paper.

















# What to do?

It is important to understand that if, say, 90% of research is p-hacked, that one cannot simply read the 10% that is not p-hacked and ignore the rest.
If it were easy to detect the p-hacked papers, we could simply avoid publishing them.
But I argue there are steps that could be taken to reduce p-hacking to an extent that research in aggregate has some value?

## Reject papers that ask silly questions

Accounting academics appear to adore "novelty", where novelty often means asking questions that no-one has even dreamed of asking before.
This is problematic for two reasons.
First, if questions are so novel that no-one has asked them, how can they be important?
Second, the ability to simply make up "interesting" research questions is a p-hacker's dream.

Too often the bar seems to be "has someone [in prior research] asked this question before?" and if the answer is "no" then the novelty bar has been cleared.
But after more than 50 years of modern empirical accounting research, the fact that no-one has asked a question should in most cases be a strike *against* a paper, not for it.
If no-one has addressed the question, then it is perhaps because no-one cares what the answer is.
If editors adopted a policy of desk-rejecting papers that ask silly questions, the pay-off to p-hacking would decline significantly.
